SpreeRandomSubscriptions
========================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevenbarragan/spree_random_subscriptions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevenbarragan/spree_random_subscriptions)

Allows you to have subscription products.

When a product subscription is paid, a subscription is created, and when a subscription is created an order with the next item to ship is created.

The next item to ship is base in all not subscription products, and it's pick randomly.

Installation
------------

Add spree_random_subscriptions to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_random_subscriptions'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_random_subscriptions:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_random_subscriptions/factories'
```
